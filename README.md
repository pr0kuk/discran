Hello dear lovers of discrete mathematics. 

First of all, I congratulate you on your admission to the best faculty in the world of the RT, and last of all, on your admission to FUPOM. 
This repository contains the discrete analysis tasks of 2019 that I solved a long time ago. 
I would like to draw your attention in advance to the fact that not all tasks from the assignment have been solved or solved correctly, 
but usually this is not required from students. 
The number of correctly solved tasks from each task can also be found in the repository. 
The solutions are divided into folders, in each folder you can find a .tex file with sources and a converted .pdf file. 
The folder name is built in the format month_number_year.
